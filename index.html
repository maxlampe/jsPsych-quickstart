On evaluation with the psychiatrist, the patient reported worsening mood for the last several years, significant anxiety, and three previous suicide attempts that she had not disclosed prior, including one suicide attempt a week ago in which she held her father’s gun up to her forehead, then put it away after thinking about her dog.
